## String Challenge
Have the function StringChallenge(strArr) take the array of strings stored in strArr, which will contain only two strings, the first parameter being the string N and the second parameter being a string K of some characters, and your goal is to determine the smallest substring of N that contains all the characters in K. For example if strArr is [aaabaaddae, aed] then the smallest substring of N that contains the characters a, e, and d is dae located at the end of the string. So for this example your program should return the string dae.

Another example if strArr is [aabdccdbcacd, aad] then the smallest substring of N that contains all of the characters in K is aabd which is located at the beginning of the string. Both parameters will be strings ranging in length from 1 to 50 characters and all of K's characters will exist somewhere in the string N. Both strings will only contains lowercase alphabetic characters.

#### Examples
Input [ahffaksfajeeubsne, jefaa]

Output aksfaje

Input [aaffhkksemckelloe, fhea]

Output affhkkse
